Similarly, in Python, when the program starts getting complicated, one of the best ways to maintain the readability of the code is to use Python comments.

Python Block comment is the only way of writing a real comment that can span across multiple lines. It is supported and preferred by Python’s PEP8 style guide since Block comments are ignored by Python interpreter or parser. However, nothing is stopping programmers from using the second ‘non-real’ way of writing multiline comments in Python which is explained below.\n",
        "* Using Docstrings: Docstrings are largely used as multiline comments in Python by many programmers since it is the closest thing to having a multiline comment feature in Python. While it is not wrong to use docstrings when we need to make multiline comments, it is important to keep in mind that there is a significant difference between docstrings and comments. Comments in Python are totally ignored by the Python Interpreter, while docstrings, when used inside the Python function, can be accessed at the run time.\n"
